# NotesApp - PHP Notes Application with Authentication

This project was developed as part of the Laracasts *PHP for Beginners* course, aiming to consolidate fundamental knowledge of the PHP language and best backend development practices.

The application is a mini notes platform with user authentication, innovative from the ground up, without frameworks. All routes, session control, authentication, database connections, and forms were created manually, reinforcing the understanding of the foundations of modern PHP.

# Technical Project Objectives

- Structure a route-based PHP application
- Create a decoupled architecture: separating presentation logic
- Develop secure authentication with password hashing
- Use PDO with prepared statements to protect against SQL injection
- Work with robust and reusable form validations
- Simulate REST routes (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) using a homemade router
- Organize the project with Composer and PSR-4 autoloading
- Create middleware to secure routes based on the user's session
- Adopt the PRG (Post-Redirect-Get) pattern to avoid data duplication

- Organizing code focused on responsibilities (controllers, views, services)
- Basic web application security (injection, hashing, session)
- Creating an infrastructure Local with MySQL, embedded PHP, and Composer
- Critical thinking about decoupling and reuse (validators, authentication, etc.)
- Initial concepts of Service Container and Dependency Injection
